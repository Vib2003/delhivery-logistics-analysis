# delhivery-logistics-analysis
This project analyzes 144,000+ delivery records inspired by Indian logistics operations (e.g., Delhivery) to identify inefficiencies, improve route performance, and understand delay patterns.

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

Key Highlights:

• Compared OSRM-estimated delivery times with actuals to identify delays

• Evaluated cutoff compliance, revealing 18% missed deadlines

• Identified route types (FTL vs. Carting) and delays of ~203 mins

• Built Matplotlib visualizations to communicate bottlenecks and patterns
